## Intro to Go

### https://bit.ly/2ExgRXx



**Welcome!**

This is an introduction to the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).  The first important thing to know about Go is that it has a mascot:

![gopher](./gopher.png)

This is a gopher.  Its job is to run around and do things you tell it to do.

For our lessons, we will be using a website called [goplay.space](https://goplay.space/).  We will be learning some basic Go while directing our gopher around the screen.

Here are all the lessons:
